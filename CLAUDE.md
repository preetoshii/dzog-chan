# Project-Specific Instructions for Claude

## Git Workflow
- DO NOT automatically commit and push changes after every modification
- Only commit and push when the user explicitly asks with phrases like:
  - "commit this"
  - "push these changes"
  - "commit and push"
  - or similar explicit requests

## Other Project Notes
- This is a Dzogchen meditation app with minimalist design
- Responses are limited to 7 words maximum
- The app uses OpenAI for responses and ElevenLabs for text-to-speech
